// Bob is preparing to pass IQ test. The most frequent task in this test is to find out which
// one of the given numbers differs from the others. Bob observed that one number usually
// differs from the others in evenness. Help Bob â€” to check his answers, he needs a program
// that among the given numbers finds one that is different in evenness, and return a position
// of this number.

// ! Keep in mind that your task is to help Bob solve a real IQ test, which means indexes of
// the elements start from 1 (not 0)
